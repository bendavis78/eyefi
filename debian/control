Description: EyeFi SDHC+WiFi card server framework
 The EyeFi cards include both some 2-8GB of SDHC storage and an
 embedded microprocessor with WiFi (802.11bgn) that can upload
 images as soon as they have been captured. While the software
 bundled with the cards is closed and Win/OSX only, the protocol
 is decently clean SOAP (like XML RPC via HTTP) and can be
 implemented with twisted and soappy.
 . 
 After associating with one of the configured wireless networks,
 the card authenticates a session with the server. The shared
 secret needs to be obtained from the settings of the Win/OSX
 application. The server can cope with multiple cards that are
 identified by their MAC address. After authentication, the card
 pushes the images that have not yet been posted to the server.
 The server unpacks the tarred bundle (optionally in a directory
 per MAC address). It then resolves the wireless networks that were
 logged by the card at the time the picture was taken into a
 geolocation using the Google API. The geolocation data is stored
 in an XMP sidecar. Finally, you can trigger your own scripts
 on complete upload, extraction and tagging.
