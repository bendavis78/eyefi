* pyexiv > 0.2 for tagging images. http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/.
  Ubuntu packages are available at
  https://launchpad.net/~pyexiv2-developers/+archive/ppa


Installation
------------

Get the card's MAC and upload key
.................................

At the moment, EyeFi cards still have to be activated using the
Windows/OSC application bundled with the card. EyeFi Center or EyeFi
Manager will write some configuration to the card and negotiate a unique
upload key with the card and the api.eye.fi server. This procedure works
also in a virtualbox with the usb card reader passed through to the
guest OS. But it does not seem to work with the card's filesystem simply
exposed to the guest. After the procedure, the mac and the key can be
found in /Users/*/AppData/Roaming/Eye-Fi/Settings.xml (Windows 7).

Configure wireless networks
...........................

eyefi-config is a nice open source tool to do that. Alternatively, the
windows application can also be used here.




* # python setup.py install
  or
  # python setup.py develop
